# Localization for BowieD.Unturned.AssetEditor

This repository is made so that community can contribute to localization of Unturned Asset Editor.

To start localizing you need to create a fork of repository and then work on the localization that you want.

If you want to create a new language support then copy one of the existing .yml files, rename to the language you want and change culture code inside of the file. Full list of culture codes can be found [here](https://azuliadesigns.com/c-sharp-tutorials/list-net-culture-country-codes/).

After you finished working on your localization you then need to make a pull request, stating changes you made. I will then make a decision to approve, decline or edit before merging.

Thanks in advance for contributing!
